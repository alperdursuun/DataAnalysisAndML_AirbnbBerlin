# DataAnalysisAndML_AirbnbBerlin
This repository contains my Data Analysis and Machine Learning project that I've developed to analyze and learn about Airbnb datas in Berlin.
You can see the main CSV file that scraped by "Insideairbnb"
You can also access to two python notebooks, each of both is represented to demonstrate the Regression and Classification methods seperately.
You can also see the IEEE paper written by me and my project partner to get some inspirations.
There's also a bunch of screenshots that I've inserted to the IEEE paper.
Paper might be a little bit amateur-ish :)
